    I realized too late that he meant for me to laugh. When I missed my cue, he brought one thick hand to the side of his neck.
“Even so, I see Young-won’s siblings as my siblings. You are like a little brother to her. So I hope you can see me as family.” His words had the unrehearsed, rushed quality of the recently humiliated.
Abruptly, I felt the brunt of my exhaustion. The sleeplessness, I had kept at bay by bringing to Young-won and her fiancee a bracketed version of myself. But at this sincerity, a hot, sour feeling filled my stomach. Their entreaty that I prioritize my own enjoyment no longer seemed rote. Somehow, I felt they would know if I faked it.
I asked Young-won’s fiancee if he liked the movie theaters in Busan, as there was a film I was hoping to see. He said he would drive me, though I might not make my movie in time. This wasn’t a problem. The important thing was to make a request strong enough to mirror this blushing earnestness.

I googled chantel ackerman busan and the internet gave me Chantal Akerman Restrospective at the Busan Cinema Center.
The closer I walked to the structure, the more impossible it felt. The enormous slabs of steel and marble matched the material of the apartments around it. From the car, it seemed that the surrounding buildings had been sliced on a mandolin and then woven together to form an enormous, pleated, baseball cap.
I glanced over my shoulder to see if Young-won and her fiancee were watching me gape at the building, but their car had already been pushed off the curb by lines of traffic. Before I had exited, Young-won’s fiancee slipped me a 100,000 won note in an envelope. I tried to object, but cars had already piled behind us.
Once under the canopy of the structure, I felt a yawning vertigo. The underside of the canopy was an LED display, changing colors like an adolescent’s mood ring. There were people all around, mostly Korean and uniformed in dark colors. I stopped someone to ask for directions to the movie theater and was pointed to one of the scattered cylindrical entrances.
Inside, I stopped on every floor to ask for further directions. Eventually, I took an elevator up to an area that was familiar. Large screens behind the ticketing desks advertised showtimes in red script. I saw Chantal Akerman: Je Tu Il Elle for 6:45pm, followed by other Akerman films every other hour until midnight. The woman at the desk mimed surprise when I asked for a ticket for Je Tu Il Elle, but quickly obliged and directed me up to the fifth floor.
A long, skinny escalator took me to the fourth, where a carpeted foyer led off into theaters and finally onto another escalator. On a bench sat Seung-ho, head craned over his phone as he absentmindedly peeled a tangerine. At first I doubted it was him, and then, just a moment later, I was very certain it was him. I was shocked at how small he seemed from afar, an impression exaggerated by his stillness. I was further shocked at how rapidly he grew in size as I walked closer.
“Hello,” I said loudly in English, and he looked up.
His bangs were clipped flat with a row of pins, revealing pale eyebrows and tiny gold hoops on his earlobes. He wore a black T-shirt with a white scribble of indecipherable text across the front, wide-legged jersey pants, and pristine white sneakers.
“Peter?” He said my name with a soft tapering into the “r.”
  <div class="column2">
    Amazingly, he kept talking. The historical significance of the movie was increasingly lost on me, but I calmed enough to sit down next to him on the bench. I knew it wasn’t possible through our many respective layers of clothing, but for a moment, I felt a wave of heat coming off of his body. A pile of tangerine discard was spreading on his crossed knees. He gave me half of the fruit he had just peeled. I ate it whole. It was extremely sour and prevented me from replying right away when he asked, “Did you take the subway here?”
  I covered my mouth as I swallowed. The citrus sank slowly in my throat. I tried to explain about Young-won, her upcoming wedding, and how my mother had sent me to assess her fiancee. This was the first time I had seen her in person in almost a decade.
  “You sound like you’re from here.”
  “My parents are from Gyeongsando. Not Busan, but it has a similar vibe to me. So I guess I have a bit of that going.”
  He made an “ah” shape with his mouth.
  “Busan is my last city. Next week, I’m going back to Seoul and then flying out to L.A.”
  “Yes, I know you are Hollywood boy,” Seung-ho said in English.
  “Glendale boy,” I corrected, though how would he know the difference. Still, he chuckled, seeming to get the joke. His laugh was simultaneously gurgled and barking.
  “We’re both Hollywood boy. We study advertising,” he corrected.
  Tentatively, I decided he wasn’t displeased that I had come.
  On the escalator, he stood in front of me, making him taller than me once more. He kept one eye on me as he chattered on about the movie and why it was important. I didn’t understand many of the words, but I nodded, doubting I would understand further explanation in any case. At the fifth floor, twin banners propped on bow-shaped piping welcomed us to the AKERMAN RETROSPECTIVE, the text emblazoned in English and then in the phoneticized Korean. The profile of a dark-haired white woman was printed on both banners, her gaze directed pointlessly towards the railing around the platform. Her photograph was blue-tinged, so I guessed she had died. There was no one waiting outside except for an employee at a stand, who ripped our tickets and then gestured us towards the theater entrance.
  The inside of the theater was dim and heads swivelled towards our movement by the door. Seung-ho grabbed my wrist so I wouldn’t lose him in the darkness. I quietly noted that his hand was warmer than it had been the previous night. He nodded upwards, steering us up the wide steps and into the very back row.
  	“How’s your eyesight?” he asked me, already sitting down in the middle seat.
  	“Not bad,” I said, as I descended into the seat next to him.
  	Once seated, Seung-ho took out his phone. It lit his face blue, highlighting the already papery quality of his skin. Awkwardly, I did, too, studying my screen with pretend enthusiasm. Young-won had sent me all her photos from the day in one massive stream. I moved to open them when the weak lights began to flatten. The theater quieted. A soft voice over the speakers requested that the audience turn off their cell phones and refrain from talking during the program.
  The screen went from gray to black. White words flashed one by one:
  je…
  tu…
  il… elle.
  Both English and Korean subtitles appeared, one line of horizontal text and one vertical: “I, You, He, She.”
  A black-and-white sequence beamed down on us. A woman sat with her back to the camera, sharing the frame with her narrow bed, vanity, and sofa. Immediately, I felt claustrophobic. I snuck a glance at Seung-ho, who was completely trained on the image before him. I looked down at the audience below us and was surprised to find that the room was nearly half-full. They, too, were focused on the screen.
  	The film was very slow. The actress, who seemed too self-conscious to be an actress, moved listlessly, speaking in sentences that had little connection with one other. She kept laying down, before mustering the motivation to move something. A table, her mattress. Her face was plain and bright, though her physicality was indecisive. About ten minutes in, she began eating from a brown bag of sugar, taking delicate, thoughtless mouthfuls from a long-handled spoon. Like the stuff was medicine. The sound of her teeth on the sugar was rough and canned. It was the only object I could sic my attention on. Apparently, this behavior was because of heartbreak.
  	Later, she left her room. She got picked up by a truck driver, whose handsomeness clashed with his shirt, full of holes, and his bad posture. He looked more like an actor than she did. At this point in the film, I felt myself nod off, my chin dropping into my chest.
  The very next moment, it seemed, the truck driver was guiding the woman’s hand down to his crotch. He was talking about the women he knew he’d never see again. And his wife and child. Then I was awake. The room, instead of being too dark, seemed preternaturally bright. She didn’t despise him. In fact, she appeared to empathize with him. I would have despised him, I thought with a start. Though I might not realize it during the act itself.
  	Eventually, she arrived at another woman’s apartment. However, the woman immediately rebuffed her, as if her presence had an obvious, intrusive meaning. At this, I stole a glance at Seung-ho out of the corner of my eye, but he had relaxed into his seat and his face was turned away from me. He rested his cheek in his hand, his elbow on his armrest.
  I looked back at the screen.
  	“I’m hungry,” the main character was saying.
  The woman let her stay until she finished a flimsy sandwich of sugar. But once she finished the sandwich, she leaned over, touched the woman’s wrist, and pushed it to the side. The woman maintained eye contact, smilin
