What to do?, 2019

Lampworked glass on pins and skewers, fountain pumps, plastic tubing, nylon rope, copper refrigeration coil, cinder blocks, canvas bags, foam, plaster and plaster gauze casts, walnut-dyed wool, charcoal, Dragon Skin, rubber tube, glass sheets, fenugreek, nasturtiums, South Indian cotton fabrics, Kashmiri embroidered pillowcase, steel wire. Made for group show of independent work by juniors in Princeton’s Visual Arts Program

Fountains, sculptures, seedlings, and furniture form a garden in the gallery. Specific plants embed associations personal to my family, my friends, and my own memory; yet, these plants’ paths into our lives reek of colonial prospecting. I quote the title, What to do?, from Jamaica Kincaid’s My Garden (Book)—the phrase was familiar to me as a British exclamation my grandmothers used often, but it also resonated with the anxiety of my young studio practice.
